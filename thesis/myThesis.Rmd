# Templates

Most universities and departments make a Word or latex template available for theses. For example, the [template in the `templates` folder](templates/thesistemplate.docx) is provided by [Simon Fraser University](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/thesis/templates).

# Bibliography

Pandoc (and by extension, RMarkdown) can support the use of a bibliography in [Bibtex format](http://www.bibtex.org/). These references can be rendered into a number of different formats using an XML-type file called the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/), or CSL. These files define how the reference is rendered and referenced in text. You can see a full list of available formats (for a large number of journals) in the [CSL Github styles repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles).
