This workshop is run virtually as part of the Geological Society of America's 2020 conference which was scheduled to be in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

We would like to begin by acknowledging that the Conference's host city is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien'kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we were to have gathered. Tiohtià:ke/Montréal is as a gathering place for many First Nations and home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

Simon Goring is presenting from Vancouver, British Columbia. I acknowledge that I am on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. They have cared for this land and I hope that my work is able to continue their legacy of stewardship in its own way.
