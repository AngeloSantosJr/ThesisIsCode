# Your Thesis is software

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Throughput

An NSF Funded Research project Goals:

- Reduce "time-to-science" for researchers
- Improve mechanisms for crediting different research outputs
- Democratize scientific software

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Components

- Education & Outreach (this workshop)
- Throughput Database
- Earth Science Cookbook

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Education & Outreach

- We are good at doing research
- We are not often good at documenting it
- We are finding new uses for old research

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Education & Outreach

- To avoid inequity in access Throughput is making tools accessible to a broader range of researchers
- We are providing new avenues to discover workflows in the geosciences
- We are providing new ways of annotating data to help improve the social dissemination of knowledge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Throughput Database

- Making connections

  - Between data & software
  - Between data & the literature
  - Between the literature & software
  - Between grants, data, software & the literature
  - Among researchers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Earth Science Cookbook

- throughputdb.com
- Keyword and full-text searches for databases and the scripts that use them.

  - How do I connect climate and soils data?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collaboration

All our work is open source & collaboration is welcome. [http://github.com/throughput-ec]()
